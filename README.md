# Parcing-Tweet-Data-Using-Python-and-Populating-SQLite-Database



## Overview
The goal of this assignment is to process, store, and analyze tweet data using Python and SQLite. The dataset contains one full day of tweets (~4.4M tweets), with subsets of 110,000 and 550,000 tweets used for specific tasks. We evaluate the performance of various operations and provide recommendations based on the results.
